# 🎮 2048 Game in Python

A simple console-based version of the popular **2048** puzzle game, developed in **Python**. The objective is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the elusive **2048** tile!

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Classic 2048 Gameplay:**  
  Slide tiles up, down, left, or right to combine them and reach 2048.
  
- **Terminal-Based Interface:**  
  Play directly in your console with a clean, dynamic display.

- **Win & Game Over Detection:**  
  Automatically recognizes when you've won or when no more moves are possible.

- **Random Tile Generation:**  
  Each valid move spawns a new tile (2 or 4) in a random empty spot.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for this project.
- **Standard Libraries**: 
  - `random`: For random tile generation.
  - `os`: To clear the console between moves for a dynamic interface.

## 📥 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
  - Check your Python version:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
  - If not installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running the Game

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2048-python.git
   cd 2048-python
Run the Game:
python 2048.py

🎮 How to Play

Controls:
Use W (up), A (left), S (down), and D (right) to move the tiles.
Example:
Enter move (w/a/s/d): w
Game Objective:
Combine tiles of the same number to create larger tiles.
Keep combining until you reach the 2048 tile.
Winning & Losing:
🎉 Win: When you create a tile with the number 2048.
❌ Game Over: When no more moves are possible.

🐛 Error Handling

Invalid Moves:
The game prevents moves when no tiles can be shifted in that direction and prompts the user to try a different move.
Input Validation:
Ensures that only valid keys (w, a, s, d) are accepted for moves.
Dynamic Display:
The console is cleared after each move for a seamless game experience.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Score Tracking:
Display the player's score based on combined tiles.
Undo Feature:
Allow players to undo the last move.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Implement using Tkinter or Pygame for a more interactive experience.
Leaderboard:
Save high scores to a file and display them at the start of the game.
